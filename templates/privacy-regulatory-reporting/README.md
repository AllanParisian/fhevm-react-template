# Privacy Regulatory Reporting System

A blockchain-based confidential regulatory reporting platform leveraging Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology to enable secure, privacy-preserving compliance reporting.

## 🌟 Overview

The Privacy Regulatory Reporting System transforms how financial institutions submit sensitive compliance data to regulators. By utilizing FHE technology through the fhEVM protocol, organizations can submit encrypted regulatory reports that remain confidential while still being verifiable on-chain.

**Smart Contract Address**: `0x0B7F69092DF31270DE216D07ca22B3B8ee237154`

**Network**: Sepolia Testnet

 
## 🎯 Core Concepts

### Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

FHE is a revolutionary cryptographic technique that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it. In the context of regulatory reporting:

- **Data Privacy**: Financial amounts, transaction counts, and risk scores remain encrypted on-chain
- **Selective Access**: Only authorized parties (regulators, analysts) can decrypt specific data
- **Verifiable Compliance**: Reports can be verified and processed while maintaining confidentiality
- **On-Chain Security**: All data is secured by blockchain immutability and FHE encryption

### Confidential Regulatory Reporting Workflow

1. **Entity Authorization**: Regulators authorize financial institutions to submit reports
2. **Report Submission**: Entities submit encrypted compliance data (amounts, transactions, risk scores)
3. **On-Chain Storage**: Encrypted data is permanently stored on the blockchain
4. **Regulator Verification**: Authorized regulators verify and process submitted reports
5. **Controlled Decryption**: Regulators grant decryption access to specific analysts when needed

### Smart Contract Architecture

The `PrivacyRegulatoryReporting` contract implements:

- **Encrypted Data Types**: `euint64` for amounts, `euint32` for transaction counts, `euint8` for risk scores
- **Role-Based Access**: Owner, Regulator, and Authorized Entity permissions
- **Reporting Periods**: Time-bound submission windows with deadlines
- **Access Control**: Granular permissions for data decryption
- **Audit Trail**: Complete on-chain record of all submissions and verifications

## 🔐 Key Features

### Privacy-Preserving Submissions
- Submit confidential financial data that remains encrypted on-chain
- Transaction amounts, counts, and risk assessments protected by FHE

## 📝 Smart Contract Functions

### Core Operations

#### Entity Management
```solidity
authorizeEntity(address entity)        // Authorize reporting entities
revokeEntity(address entity)           // Revoke authorization
isAuthorizedEntity(address) returns (bool)  // Check authorization status
```

#### Report Submission
```solidity
submitConfidentialReport(
    uint64 totalAmount,
    uint32 transactionCount,
    uint8 riskScore,
    uint256 periodId
)
```

#### Report Verification
```solidity
verifyReport(uint256 reportId)         // Mark report as verified
processReport(uint256 reportId)        // Process verified report
grantDecryptionAccess(uint256 reportId, address analyst)  // Grant access
```

#### Period Management
```solidity
createReportingPeriod(uint256 duration, uint256 deadlineDays)
closePeriod(uint256 periodId)
getCurrentPeriod() returns (uint256)
```

#### Data Retrieval
```solidity
getReportInfo(uint256 reportId) returns (address, uint256, uint256, bool, bool)
getPeriodInfo(uint256 periodId) returns (uint256, uint256, bool, uint256, uint256)
getTotalReports() returns (uint256)
```
